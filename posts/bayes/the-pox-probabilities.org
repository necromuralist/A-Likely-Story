* Beginning
  This is a look at calculating which is more likely for a patient with spots on his face - chicken pox or measles. It's an example adapted from the book /Bayes' Rule/ (see below).

** Probabilities
*** Spots
    The spots are the symptom, and the probability is the number of people in the population with spots (for any reason) divided by the total population.

#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
Spots = Namespace(
    probability=0.081
)
#+end_src
*** Measles
    These are the probabililities for measles so we can use Bayes' Theorem.
\[
p(measles| spots) = \frac{p(spots|measles)(measles)}{p(spots)}
\]

#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
Measles = Namespace(
    probability=2.9e-06,
    probability_of_spots_given_measles=0.9,
    probability_of_spots=Spots.probability,
    name="Measles",
)
#+end_src

The =probability= is an estimate of the fraction of the population that gets measles in the United States per year. This turns /really/ small, even though 2019 had the most cases in a decade (981).
*** Chicken Pox
    And here's the probabilities and equation for chicken pox.

\[
p(chicken pox|spots) = \frac{p(spots|chicken pox)p(chicken pox)}{p(spots)}
\]

#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
ChickenPox = Namespace(
    probability = 0.001,
    probability_of_spots_given_chickenpox = 0.8,
    probability_of_spots = Spots.probability,
    name = "Chicken Pox"
)
#+end_src

I don't really know the probability that you'll get spots given each disease. Now that we have vaccines for both of them, though, they appear to be quite rare.
*** Diseases
    I was re-using the disease instances, but I'm changing the definitions as I go, so I need to create them everytime a test gets run and this next bit is to help with that.

**** Any Disease
     Since I'm re-using the Disease class I don't really need to re-test it (I think), but I just ran across [[https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Hypothesis]] and want to try it out, so I'll make a generic version.

#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
@given(floats(min_value=SMALLEST, max_value=1), 
       floats(SMALLEST, 1), 
       floats(SMALLEST, 1),
       text(min_size=1))
def test_disease(prior, likelihood, marginal, name):
    expected = (prior * likelihood)/marginal
    # Given a disease
    disease = Disease(prior_probability=prior,
                      likelihood=likelihood,
                      marginal_likelihood=marginal,
                      name=name)
    # when the posterior is retrieved
    actual = disease.posterior_probability
    # then it is close enough    
    expect(isclose(actual, expected, abs_tol=1e-3)).to(be_true)
    return
#+end_src

This turned out to show that I wasn't checking division by zero cases, so I guess it is good to do more testing.
*** The Diagnosis
**** Blocking Infinite Probabilities
     Bayes' Rule has divisions in it (either calculating the /posterior probability/ or /posterior ratio/) so I'm going to block letting the /prior probability/ or /marginal probability/ be zero by raising an exception.
***** Zero Marginal Likelihood
      This means the probability of the data is zero (no one has spots as a symptom of disease).
#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
def test_zero_marginal_likelihood():
    # Given a disease with zero marginal likelihood
    def bad_call():
        disease_1 = Disease(prior_probability=0.5,
                            likelihood=0.5,
                            marginal_likelihood=0,
                            name="bad diseases")
        return
    
    # When the disease is created
    # Then it raises an exception
    expect(bad_call).to(raise_error(AssertionError))
    return
#+end_src
***** Zero Prior Probability
      This means the probability of the hypothesis is (was) zero - no one has this disease.
#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
def test_zero_prior():
    # Given a disease with zero prior probability
    def bad_call():
        disease_1 = Disease(prior_probability=0,
                            likelihood=0.5,

                            name="bad diseases")
        return

    # When the disease is created
    # Then it raises an exception
    expect(bad_call).to(raise_error(AssertionError))
    return
#+end_src
***** Zero Likelihood
      This means the probability of the data given the hypothesis is zero no - one with this disease has these symptoms.
#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
def test_zero_likelihood():
    # Given a disease with zero likelihood
    def bad_call():
        disease_1 = Disease(prior_probability=0.5,
                            likelihood=0,
                            marginal_likelihood=0.5,

        return

    # When the disease is created
    # Then it raises an exception
    expect(bad_call).to(raise_error(AssertionError))
    return
#+end_src

**** Getting Diseases Back
    The Diagnosis maintains the diseases both as attributes and in a dictionary which lets you retrieve them back out.
#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
def test_measles_retrieval():
    # Given a Diagnosis with chicken pox and small pox
    diseases = Poxes()
    diagnosis = diseases.diagnosis
    # When the measles is retrieved
    actual = diagnosis[diseases.measles.name]
    # Then it has the correct posterior probability
    expect(actual).to(be(diseases.measles))
    return
#+end_src
**** Finding the Most Likely Disease
The diagnosis should also decide which one is the more likely disease.
#+begin_src python :session pox :results none
def test_measles_or_chicken_pox():
    diseases = Poxes()
    # Given a diagnosis with measles and chicken_pox
    diagnosis = diseases.diagnosis
    # When the best-guess is retrieved
    guess = diagnosis.most_likely
    # Then it is the chicken_pox

** Inspecting
   While the tests sort of give us a decent sense that things are working, let's take a look at the actual numbers.

#+begin_src python :session pox :results output :exports both
print(str(Poxes().diagnosis))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Disease 1: Measles, Posterior Probability: 0.000
: Disease 2: Chicken Pox, Posterior Probability: 0.988
: Most Likely: Chicken Pox, Posterior Ratio: 30,651.341

So Chicken Pox is about thirty-thousand times more likely to be the reason for the spots than Measles (unless you live in the Pacific Northwest, perhaps).
